                  <p class="mb-4">
                    Wiese USA is a servicer and distributor of Material Handling Equipment (MHE). Wiese has approximately 800 mobile technicians (mechanics) dispersed across 50 faciliEes in 17 states.
                    These technicians receive ongoing technical training from both Wiese and the manufacturers of the
                    equipment they service. Each year, Wiese needs to schedule technical training for each technician in this geographically dispersed
                    workforce. Each locaEon has a diverse group of training needs based on their tenure, training path, and
                    personal advocacy.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Therefore to optimize the cost required, and to increase the overall level 
                    of each technician, we built three Mixed integer models. In Model 1, we maximize the number of courses a student can take that will
                    increase their training level. It is an assignment problem. In Model 2, we try to maximize the courses while minimizing the travel time by
                    keeping an upper bound on the travel time. In Model 3, we try to increase the number of instructors to meet the
                    requirement that in a given year, all the students should complete the required
                    maximum number of courses.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We scheduled a plan for organization training plan for one year. We have used the assignment networking problem to assign technicians to
                    their respective locations and weeks. Two important variables- instructor and students/technicians. We have developed a "week-wise" strategy that limits the number of times
                    an instructor can teach to once every four weeks. Additionally, we divided the year into five fractions. This will be useful if the
                    model is just going to be used for a portion of the year and the analysis is not
                    needed for the entire year.

                  <p class="mb-4">
                    The existence of Android Malware has always been a matter of concern as it was a by-product of this great technology. With advancement of this technology many steps were taken to
                    mitigate this threat but with ever evolving technology and expanding user base many new
                    methods have emerged to take advantage of these flaws. Therefore, there is a pressing need
                    to improve our methods of classifying and mitigating these threats. With this project we have
                    tried to create a solution to detect and classify prominent malwares by using various Machine
                    Learning techniques that are creating a menace for android users. This work detects benign
                    and malicious malwares and also classifies malicious malwares in 14 major categories like
                    Adware, Riskware, Trojan to name a few. We tried to improve our results at each step and
                    the best accuracy we got was 67.7% with Random Decision Forest Classifier.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As the dataset was large we sampled the dataset using different statistical techniques such as
                    simple random sampling, stratified random sampling, cluster sampling and systematic
                    sampling.and used that sample to train our model. The sample was compared to original population
                    using hypothesis test. The Dataset has 14 different categories of malicious families, and the data is unbalanced with
                    some categories having more data points than others. In this project we used multiclass data
                    balancing techniques where each class is increased accordingly.
                    The techniques like SMOTE, ADASYN, SMOTE+ENN were implemented to increase the data.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    After the data pre processing and balancing we trained traditional ML models and experimented our results. Also built 
                    Neural Network Architecture for classification. The results can be found out in the given link provided.

                  <p class="mb-4">
                    Identifying where the image might have taken or the clothes wore by people may be helpful for us in various ways. Some applications can be, implementing
                    an end to end sytem to enhance an image based on the culture of the particular place, where it can be used as a first step. At the same time, the same photos can be used for authenticating genuine marriage or fake marriage and kinship verification. 
                    Therefore here I have presented novel method based on the combination of U-Net, Convolutional Neural Network and Random Forest for classification of multicultural wedding images.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    At first we segmented the region of interest, which included the portions of dresses or costumes with wedding couples. 
                    For this task we implemented UNet architecture which has ability to segment irrespective of background complexities. 
                    After segmenting region of interest, to extract distinct features for classification of images, we explore the Convolutional 
                    Neural Network (CNN) as it has the ability to extract context information between the pixels in the images.
                    Features extracted from CNN architecture is used as an input in Random Forest (RF), for classification of images of different cultures. 
                    The reason to use RF for classification is that it does not require a large number of samples and it avoids the cause of overfitting.

                  <p class="mb-4">
                    Over the last few decades, the impact of social media on an individual has increased exponentially, which has led to certain demerits 
                    such as cyber bullying. In this project, we built a NLP model to classify social comments based on Hope Speech, Non-Hope Speech and Neutral speech ontology.

                  <p>
                    The model consists of three units, the pre-processing unit, the feature extraction and data 
                    balancing unit, and the classification unit (as shown in the figure). In the pre-processing unit, the dataset is cleaned up 
                    by removing unwanted text portions, expanding the abbreviations, and using lemmatization 
                    to convert words to their root words. The output of this step is then fed to the feature 
                    extraction unit that uses the TF-IDF vectorization technique to identify the importance of 
                    specific words or phrases in the dataset. Therefore, the sentences in the dataset are converted 
                    to vectors of different values. These vectors are then used to balance the dataset using data 
                    balancing methods like SMOTE and ADASYN by adding some synthetic samples

                    The output from the above steps is given to the final unit, which constitutes various traditional Machine Learning models like Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression and SVM. These models were 
                    implemented using the scikit-learn library available in python. We experimented the result with certain traditional model and also implemented BERT architecture.

                  <p class="mb-4">
                    A Structured Query Language injection (SQLi) attack is also commonly referred to as a code injection attack, 
                    is a security vulnerability which allows access to data which is intended to be protected and inaccessible to unauthorized personnel.
                    Therefor to mitigate such attacks we proposed a Machine Learning model which used Random Decision Trees as classifier.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We Collected data(malicious sql queries) and identified features which were comment characters, number of semicolons, Logical operators, True 
                    conditions, keywords and wildcard characters to streamline the data for better insights. Scored a list of keywords according to their
                    risk factors for better understanding the data. This model was then trained over the new created dataset where we implemented Random Decision Trees classifier.
